# 🚀 Khadak Ozar Grampanchayat - Deployment Guide

## 📋 What You Need to Deploy

Your project has **TWO parts** that need separate hosting:

1. **Frontend** (React Website) → Deploy to **Netlify** ✅
2. **Backend** (Node.js + Admin Panel) → Deploy to **Render.com** ✅

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Netlify CANNOT host your backend. You must use both services.
