        "Since ancient times, the goddess's chariot has been taken out with great pomp from the temple to Khadakozar village on Chaitra Vaishakh Navami. All villagers and devotees from Panch Kroshi gather in large numbers for this chariot procession. During Navratri, thousands of devotees visit the mother's feet daily.",
        "During this period, the temple administration organizes electric lighting and religious programs. Similarly, foot pilgrimage festivals are held every year from the temple to Kedrai to Shirdi, Kedrai Mata to Gangapur, Kedrai Mata to Trimbakeshwar.",
        "Saptashringi Fort is 28 km from Kedrai Mata temple and Renuka Mata temple in Chandwad is 22 km. Also in the lower eastern range of Sahyadri, near Saptashringi Fort, Markandeya Mountain, Dhodap Fort, Vikhara Mountain, Kanchan Fort, Idrayani Fort, Renuka Temple in Chandwad, Chandreshwar Temple, Ichhapurti Ganesh Temple, famous Rangmahal are historical places that can be seen at a distance of 20 to 25 km.",
        "The distance to Shirdi is 70 to 75 km from here. No matter how much we talk about Kedrai Mata, it is less. We should visit this awakened temple and definitely take the mother's blessings.",
        "The village has been running continuous Hari Nam Saptah for the last 90 years and this year in April 2025, it will complete 90 years continuously and we will celebrate the golden jubilee in another 10 years.",
        "✨ Khadakozar – A small but ideal, prosperous village preserving historical heritage!",
